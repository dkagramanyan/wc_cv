The obtained samples underwent preliminary microscopic examination using optical microscopy before and after etching in Murakami's reagent to reveal free carbon inclusions and phases, as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray microanalysis on a Tescan Vega TS5130 MM instrument equipped with an Oxford Instruments LINK energy-dispersive spectrometer. Image size is 100 by 100 μm. Digital image size is 3072 by 1680 pixels, each pixel has 256 shades of gray.
